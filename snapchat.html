  	<h4>Lenses</h4>
    <p>While taking photos or videos, users are given the ability to apply "lenses."
      These lenses use facial recognition software to make digital changes to the
    user's face. This produces unique effects such as making the user's eyes or mouth
    larger. The lense feature has made Snapchat extremely popular with its user base. </p>
    <h4>Chat</h4>
    <p>One of Snapchat's main features is the chat feature. Here, users are able
    to contact each other through short texts, photos, or videos. Additionally, users
  are able to send personal "bitmojis," which are emoticons that the user has customized.</p>
    <h4>Geo Location</h4>
    <p>Perhaps one of the most controversial featurse of Snapchat is its "geo-location"
    feature. It allows users to hide or display their current location and view
    the current location of other users. Using a smartphone's hardware, Snapchat is
    able to accurately assume if users are in a car or sleeping.</p>

    <h3>My Experience</h3>
    <p>My experience with Snapchat has been tumultuous. In the past, I used SnapChat religiously;
    I would spend hours chatting with friends or posting on my story. After a while, my enthusiasm
    for Snapchat has mellowed down. Now, I rarely use SnapChat because I prefer to keep updated
    on my friends' lives through Instagram. I give Snapchat a rating of 2/5 because I mostly just use
   it for its lense feature.</p>
